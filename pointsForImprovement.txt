implement EF for data access (I prefer this)
or 
stored proc, existed way is not the best

logging (interceptin global exceptions and for each significant action)

implementation of use dependensy injection and data transfering objects to avoid of using full objects (avoid to send not needed information)

using meaningful variable names according to their purpose (ex:not messages for users)

add more annotation

unit tests

in this examle I started but did not have time to implement a method that would return only the required number of filtered lines.
i belive this is necessary, because with a large number of records that will appear over time.
there will be a problem with processing a huge piece of data on frontend side.
